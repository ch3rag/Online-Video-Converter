\section{Preliminary Investigation}
		\vs
		\hspace{1cm} A preliminary system study is the first stage of the system development life cycle. This is a brief investigation of the system under consideration and gives a clear picture of what the physical system is? In this stage, the need for the system is evaluated. The initial system study involves the preparation of a "Project Overview" which lists the Problem with the existing system, Objectives of the proposed system, Scope of the proposed System, Constraints, Expected benefits of the new system, etc. in the light of the user requirements. The main steps followed in this stage are: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Problem identification and project initiation.
			\item Background analysis.
			\item Inference or findings (system proposal).
			\item Determine the size of the project.
			\item Assess the costs and benefits of approaches.
			\item Determine the technical feasibility of approaches.
		\end{itemize}
